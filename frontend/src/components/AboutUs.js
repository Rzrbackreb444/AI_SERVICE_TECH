              LaundroTech isn't some Silicon Valley fever dream cooked up by tech bros in hoodies who think "laundromat" is spelled with a "K." We're not venture-backed tourists playing dress-up in an industry they've never touched.

                My grandfather, <strong>Jerry Kremers</strong>, was a Speed Queen distributor who owned laundromats when most people thought they were just coin-operated washing machines.

                <strong>2018.</strong> Massive hemorrhagic stroke. Half my body gone. Independence‚Äîgone. For a minute there, I thought everything I'd built, everything I knew, was finished.
