The AI engineer continued the development of the LaundroTech Intelligence (SiteAtlas) platform, focusing on comprehensive payment integration, dynamic pricing updates, and robust enterprise-grade enhancements. Initial work involved implementing a detailed six-tier pricing model for Facebook Group badge monetization, integrating PayPal and Stripe, and setting up SendGrid for email notifications. A significant challenge was a persistent back-and-forth with the user regarding correct Stripe API credentials, specifically differentiating between publishable and secret keys. After successfully integrating all payment gateways and email services with live credentials, the user requested a full suite of enterprise enhancements. This led to the development of a user dashboard, an admin dashboard, a customer support system, and subsequently, advanced analytics with mapping, heatmaps, and comprehensive user profile/security management. The current work is focused on resolving a frontend icon import issue that appeared during a screenshot attempt after the implementation of these extensive features.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing a full suite of enterprise-grade features as requested by the user (take it all the way). This involved creating multiple new frontend components and supporting backend endpoints:
- **Frontend Components**: , , , , .

The latest action was taking a screenshot to demonstrate the complete system, which resulted in a  in a Python script during the screenshot process, and the screenshot itself still showing the Facebook Group page, suggesting an issue with the screenshot or the newly added routes rendering. The AI engineer noted import issues with the icons as the immediate problem to address.
