The previous AI engineer's trajectory involved resolving critical bugs and expanding core application features. Initially, the focus was on fixing a backend  and a broken frontend mobile drawer, followed by enhancing the AI consultant into a context-aware system. The user then pushed for a LaundroTech Marketplace, leading to backend/frontend development plagued by server connectivity issues (missing dependencies, misconfigured API routes) and frontend compilation errors.

The engineer systematically resolved the server issues (installing ), fixed authentication problems (registration, login, and dashboard redirection by adding a missing FastAPI decorator, and persisting user data/JWT tokens), and debugged frontend marketplace rendering (icon imports). A significant effort was dedicated to upgrading the AI consultant to be personalized, subscription-aware, and have conversation memory. Despite these successes, the user still perceives parts of the platform as basic or mock-data driven, particularly regarding subscription management and full enterprise-grade features. The current task involves a comprehensive audit and enhancement to achieve a premium, Vercel-like full business suite.

The LaundroTech Intelligence Platform aims to be an AI-powered business intelligence solution for laundromat investment, expanding into healthcare via SiteAtlas, targeting professionals. It requires an enterprise-grade, Vercel-level UI/UX with advanced visualizations. Key features include MRR optimization, a personalized, self-learning AI consultant adapting to user stages and subscriptions, revenue strategies (preview/blur, pay-per-depth), and comprehensive business infrastructure. It must include an integrated, fully legit marketplace with real-time, location-aware listings, instant analysis, and transaction facilitation, with robust onboarding for brokers. A full, optimal user management system is also required. Recent user feedback emphasizes the AI consultant syncing with user profiles, real (not mock) subscription management, dynamic learning, and ensuring the entire platform, from analysis to reporting and competition intelligence, is fully enterprise-grade.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive enhancement effort following user frustration regarding basic and mock-data driven functionalities. The user explicitly demanded a full audit and complete enhancement of the platform to achieve a premium, Vercel-like full business suite, including enterprise-grade analytics, reporting, user management, and marketplace intelligence, with absolutely no mock data. The AI engineer acknowledged this demand, agreeing to build out the platform properly as a complete enterprise platform from the ground up. As a first step, the AI added a prominent sign-out button in  and then started the audit by checking  to verify its data integration status, confirming it uses real data. The next immediate action was to check the corresponding frontend component, .
